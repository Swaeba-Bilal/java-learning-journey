## 🧳 Projects Overview

### 🔹 [MoodTracker](./MoodTracker)
A simple Java console app to track moods with timestamps, allowing mood searches by date and time.

### 🔹 [MusicShop](./MusicShop)
A simulation of a music shop using Object-Oriented Programming concepts like abstract classes and interfaces.

### 🔹 [Library Management System](./LibraryManagementSystem)
A console-based system to manage books in a library. Features include add, search, sort, checkout, and return.

### 🔹 [Shape Project](./ShapeProject)
An OOP-based project modeling geometric shapes using inheritance and polymorphism.

### 🔹 Travel Planner

A console-based Java program for planning trips using dates and durations with LocalDate and ChronoUnit.
### 🔹 FileSystemManager  
A console-based file manager that mimics basic shell commands like `ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `touch`, `rm`, `rename`, and more.  
It uses Java File I/O, OOP, and command parsing to interact with the file system.

📁 Folder: `FileSystemManager`
📄 Main File: `FileSystemManager.java`


## 🛠 Technologies Used
- Java SE
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Java I/O & File Handling

## 🧪 About the Projects
These projects were developed as part of my learning and practice during the **IBM Java course**.  
They demonstrate core Java concepts, clean code practices, and simple problem-solving with OOP principles.

## 🚀 How to Run the Projects
1. Navigate to the project folder you want to run.
2. Compile and run the Java files. (Each main file contains a `main()` method.)
3. Example:
   javac MoodTracker.java
   java MoodTracker
