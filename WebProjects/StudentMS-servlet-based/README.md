Student Management System – Servlet Based 🏫

A Java Web Application built with Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and MySQL to manage student records.
This is part of my Java Learning Journey repository, where I explore both console-based and web-based Java projects.
The repository will continue to grow as I extend my learning into more advanced Java frameworks and tools.
🚀 **Project Overview**

The Student Management System is designed as a Dynamic Web Project (Eclipse + Tomcat) that follows the MVC (Model–View–Controller) pattern.
It provides a structured way to manage students’ data, including CRUD operations, and introduces role-based access with admin authentication.
✨ **Features**

**Student Management (CRUD)**

Add, update, delete, and list student records.
**Responsive JSP Views**

Built with JSP + JSTL for dynamic rendering.

**Database Integration**

MySQL used as backend to store student information.

**Scalable Structure**

Organized codebase with Servlets (Controller), JSP (View), and DAO (Model).
🛠️**Tech Stack**

Java (JDK 17+)

Jakarta Servlet API (Tomcat 10 compatible)

JSP + JSTL 3.0

Apache Tomcat 10

MySQL Database

Eclipse IDE (Dynamic Web Project)
🔮 **Future Improvements**

This is a learning project and will be extended over time:

Add Spring Boot version of the project.

Enhance UI with JSP + Bootstrap/Tailwind CSS.

Introduce REST API for external access.

Role-based access for multiple admins/users.

Deployment on a cloud platform (Heroku, AWS, or similar).
